# YoutubeCinema

WebExtension to watch YouTube videos without the distracting cruft around it, in the full window.

It simply redirects visits to e.g. `youtube.com/watch?v=12345` to `youtube.com/embed/12345`.

To view a full-window video in its usual crufty context, click the extension's icon. It will then remain deactivated in that video's tab.
